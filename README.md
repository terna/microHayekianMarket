# microHayekianMarket
A tiny example of market built on independent agents, considering the Hayek's perspective.

A suggested reading about Hayek is a quite recent paper of [Bowles et al. (2017)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.31.3.215).

The file *microHayekianMarket.ipynb* contains the first release of the example.

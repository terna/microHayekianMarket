The purpose of the note is that of introducing a very simple agent-based model of a market, with emergent (quite interesting)  price dynamics.

 A counter example is also introduced, showing how with tiny modification we generate implausible price dynamics.

The code uses the IPython\footnote{\url{https://ipython.org}.} language (interaction with Python\footnote{\url{https://www.python.org}.}) and can be dowloaded from \url{https://github.com/terna/microHayekianMarket} using the \emph{Clone or download} button; it is also possible to run it directly on line at \\\url{https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/terna/microHayekianMarket/master?filepath=microHayekianMarket.ipynb}.

A suggested reading about Hayek is a quite recent paper of \citeauthor{10.1257/jep.31.3.215} (\citeyear{10.1257/jep.31.3.215}).

\section{The structure of the model and the \emph{warming up} phase}\label{The structure of the model}\index{structure}

Our agents are simply prices, to be interpreted as reservation prices.\footnote{The $max$ price a buyer could pay and the $min$ one a seller could accept.}

We have two price vectors: $pL^b$ with item $pL^b_i$ for the buyers, and $pL^s$ with item $pL^s_j$ for the sellers. The $i^{th}$ or the $j^{th}$ elements of the vectors are prices, but  we can use them also as agents.

Both in the hayekian perspective (Section \ref{The hayekian version}) and in the unstructured one (Section \ref{The unstructured version}) we have to pre-run the \emph{warning up} action. This happens automatically, calling the specific function in the beginning of both the cases.

In this phase, we define:

\begin{itemize}
\item $d_0$ - the lower bound of the random uniform numbers, both for the buyers and the sellers, in the warming up phase; 

in the running phase, the lower bound is $0$;
\item $d_1$ - the upper bound of the random uniform numbers for the buyers;
\item $d_2$ - the upper bound of the random uniform numbers for the sellers;
\item $nCycles$ - number of simulation cycles;
\item $nBuyers$  - number of the buyers;
\item $nSellers$ - number of the sellers;
\item $seed$ - the seed of the random numbers;
\item the initial buyer $i$ reservation price, different for each buyer: $p_{b,i}=\frac{1} {1 + u_i}$ with $u_i\sim\mathcal{U}(d_0,d_1)$;
\item the initial seller $j$ reservation price, different for each seller: $p_{s,j}=1 + u_j$ with $u_j\sim\mathcal{U}(d_0,d_2)$;
\item $buyersSellersRatio$ - the ratio $\frac{nBuyers}{nSellers}$;
\item $sellersBuyersRatio$ - the ratio $\frac{nSellers}{nBuyers}$;
\item $usingRatios$ - a logic variable.
\end{itemize}

With  $d_0=0.1$, $d_1=0.2$, $d_2=0.2$, sorting in decreasing order the vector  $pL^b$ and in increasing order the vector  $pL^s$ we obtain two not overlapping price sequences that we can interpret as a demand curve and an offer one (Fig. \ref{output_3_1.png}).

\caption{An example of initial not overlapping demand curve and offer curve}
\label{output_3_1.png}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

This is the \emph{warming up}, or starting situation, of the model. To generate new examples related to Section \ref{The hayekian version} and to Section \ref{The unstructured version}, it is necessary to repeat this phase. This happens automatically, calling the specific function in the beginning of both the cases.

\section{The hayekian version}\label{The hayekian version}\index{hayekian version}
 
The buyers and the sellers meet randomly. Buyer $i$ and seller $j$ exchange if  $pL^b_i \geq pL^s_j$; the deal is recorded at the price of the seller $pL^s_j$.\footnote{In the $mall$, sell prices are public.}

In this version, representing the key point in this note, the running prices are changing being multiplied in each cycle by following the correction coefficients:

\begin{itemize}
\item for the buyer: (i) $c_b=\frac{1} {1 + u_b}$ if the deal succeeds (trying to pay less next time) or (ii) $c_b=1 + u_b$ if the deal fails (preparing to pay more next time); in (i) and (ii) we have $u_b\sim\mathcal{U}(0,d_1)$

\item for the seller: (iii) $c_s=1 + u_s$ if the deal succeeds (preparing to obtain a higher revenue next time) or (iv) $c_s=\frac{1} {1 + u_s}$  if the deal fails (preparing to obtain a lower revenue next time); in (iii) and (iv) we have $u_s\sim\mathcal{U}(0,d_2)$.
\end{itemize}

With $seed=111$, $d_1=0.2$, $d_2=0.2$ and $nCycles$ set to $10,000$ we obtain sequences of mean prices (mean within each cycle) quite realistic, with a very low variance within each cycle (see Fig. \ref{output_3_2.png} and \ref{output_3_3.png}).

\label{output_3_2.png}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The \emph{coefficient of variation} at time $t$ is calculated as: $$\frac{standard~deviation_t}{mean_t}$$.

A comment: we have a plausible series of mean prices, with a complicated behavior, and with a high stability of the dispersion of the values within each cycle.

\section{The unstructured version}\label{The unstructured version}\index{unstructured version}

The buyers and the sellers meet randomly as in Section \ref{The hayekian version}. Buyer $i$ and seller $j$ exchange in any case; the deal is recorded at the mean of the price of the seller $pL^s_j$ and of the price $pL^b_i$ of the buyer.

In this version the running prices are changing being multiplied in each cycle by following the correction coefficients:

\begin{itemize}

\item with the same probability for the buyer: (i) $c_b=\frac{1} {1 + u_b}$ or (ii) $c_b=1 + u_b$); in (i) and (ii) we have $u_b\sim\mathcal{U}(0,d_1)$

\item  with the same probability for the seller: (iii) $c_s=1 + u_s$ or (iv) $c_s=\frac{1} {1 + u_s}$; in (iii) and (iv) we have $u_s\sim\mathcal{U}(0,d_2)$.
\end{itemize}

With $seed=111$, $d_1=0.2$, $d_2=0.2$ and $nCycles$ set to $10,000$ we obtain exploding sequences of mean prices (mean in each cycle), and exploding standard deviation within each cycle (see Fig. \ref{output_4_2.png} and \ref{output_4_3.png}).

\label{output_4_2.png}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The \emph{coefficient of variation} at time $t$ is calculated as: $$\frac{standard~deviation_t}{mean_t}$$.

\thispagestyle{fancy}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Case $nBuyers \gg nSellers$}
With $nBuyers \gg nSellers$ (e.g., $nBuyers=100$ and $nSellers=50$, as in Fig. \ref{output_3_1a.png}), we have two possible path of analysis. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Case $nBuyers \gg nSellers$, with different rates of per-capita correction}\label{nBuyers > nSellers with different rates of per-capita correction}\index{nBuyers > nSellers with different rates of per-capita correction}

If $nBuyers \gg nSellers$, having in each cycle one call to a  \emph{seller} from each  \emph{buyer}, the number of per-capita actions of the \emph{sellers} in each cycle is greater of the number of per-capita actions of the \emph{buyers}.

As a consequence, the probability that a \emph{seller} decreases her price to meet a \emph{b}uyer is greater than the probability that a \emph{buyer} increases her price to meet a \emph{seller}. 

We can observe that in Figs. \ref{output_3_2a.png} and \ref{output_3_3a.png} the prices are---in the end---lower than in Figs. \ref{output_3_2.png} and \ref{output_3_3.png} and, must of all, the price tendence has a strong negative slope. We have always $seed=111$.

This result is inconsistent with the microeconomic theory, where an excess of demand is supposed to increase the prices.

\subsection{Case $nBuyers \ll nSellers$}
With $nBuyers \ll nSellers$ (e.g., $nBuyers=50$ and $nSellers=100$, as in Fig. \ref{output_3_1b.png}), we have two possible path of analysis. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Case $nBuyers \ll nSellers$, with different rates of per-capita correction}\label{nBuyers < nSellers with different rates of per-capita correction}\index{nBuyers < nSellers with different rates of per-capita correction}

If $nBuyers \ll nSellers$, having in each cycle one call to a  \emph{buyer} from each  \emph{seller}, the number of per-capita actions of the \emph{buyers} in each cycle is greater of the number of per-capita actions of the \emph{sellers}.

As a consequence, the probability that a \emph{buyer} increases her price to meet a \emph{seller} is greater than the probability that a \emph{seller} decreases her price to meet a \emph{buyer}. 

We can observe that in Figs. \ref{output_3_2b.png} and \ref{output_3_3b.png} the prices are---in the end---greater than in Figs. \ref{output_3_2.png} and \ref{output_3_3.png} and, must of all, the price tendence has a strong positive slope. We have always $seed=111$.

This result is inconsistent with the microeconomic theory, where an excess of offer is supposed to decrease the prices.
